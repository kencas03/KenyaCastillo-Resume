        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I'm Kenya! I grew up in Rancho Cucamonga, CA, but I've had the opportunity to live in Mexico and in Chicago, Illinois. I'm currently a third year Biology major at the University of California, Riverside. With my Bachelor's of Science in Biology, I plan to attend medical school and achieve my goal of becoming a pediatrician with a speciality in children with disabilities.<br><br>

        My passion for medicine and my desire to get one-on-one patient interaction has led me to be a part of the COPE Health Scholar Program as a Health Scholar at the Riverside Community Hospital (RCH) site. Through this program, I have not only helped with improving patient satisfaction, but I have also had the privilege to learn and hear stories from patients that have impacted me in a way that made me look at life in a different perspective. Furthermore, my love for this program has lead me to become an ambassador, where I had the opportunity to interview incoming health scholars, as well the opportunity to help teach them patient skills, such as discharging a patient, during Training Day 1. During Training Day 2, I was a facilitator, where I observed the health scholars as they complete an assigned skill for their practical exam.<br><br>

        During the summer of 2022, I was an orientation leader, where I lead 12-17 students around campus teaching them about what it means to be a UCR student and our campus values and traditions. Previously, I was a Link Crew Leader at my high school, so my experience and my ability to help my students succeed as they transition from middle school to high school encouraged me to do the same in college. I enjoyed helping many incoming college students and family members with their questions and concerns. Through this experience I was able to improve my public speaking skills and teamwork skills since a majority part of the program revolves around working in a team and relying on each other to make the program be successful.
